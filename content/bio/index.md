## Professional Background

Jeffrey A. Zyjeski brings a unique perspective to speculative fiction through his extensive background in law, government relations, and contemplative practice. With a Juris Doctor from the University of Connecticut School of Law, he has spent over 25 years navigating the complex intersections of legal frameworks, corporate interests, and governmental policy.

His professional experience spans multiple sectors, providing him with deep insights into how institutional power operates and how technological innovation intersects with regulatory and ethical considerations. This background informs his fiction writing, particularly in exploring how emerging technologies might be shaped by corporate and governmental interests.

## Spiritual and Contemplative Practice

For more than three decades, Zyjeski has maintained a dedicated meditation and spiritual practice, drawing primarily from Buddhist traditions while remaining open to insights from various contemplative paths. This long-term commitment to inner development provides the authentic foundation for his exploration of consciousness and spiritual themes in his writing.

His practice includes:
- Daily meditation and mindfulness training
- Study of Buddhist philosophy and psychology
- Participation in retreat experiences and intensive practice periods
- Integration of contemplative principles into daily life and professional work
